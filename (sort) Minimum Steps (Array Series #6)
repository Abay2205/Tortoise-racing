/*
Task
Given an array of N integers, you have to find how many times you have to add up the smallest numbers in the array until their Sum becomes greater or equal to K.

Notes:
List size is at least 3.

All numbers will be positive.

Numbers could occur more than once , (Duplications may exist).

Threshold K will always be reachable.

  numbers.sort((a, b)=>a-b);
  let counter = 0;
  let sum = 0;
  for(let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++){
    sum += numbers[i];
    if(value-sum>=numbers[0]) counter++;
  }
  return counter;
