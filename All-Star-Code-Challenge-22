/*
seconds to hours & minutes codewars.
Create a function called toTime() that takes an integer argument of seconds and converts the value into a string describing how many hours and minutes comprise that many seconds. 
Any remaining seconds left over are ignored. Note: The string output needs to be in the specific form - "X hour(s) and X minute(s)"
