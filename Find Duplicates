/*
Given an array, find the duplicates in that array, and return a new array of those duplicates. The elements of the returned array should appear in the order when they first appeared as duplicates.

Note: numbers and their corresponding string representations should not be treated as duplicates (i.e., "1" != 1).

Examples
[1, 2, 4, 4, 3, 3, 1, 5, 3, "5"]  ==>  [4, 3, 1]
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]                ==>  []
*/

function duplicates(arr) {
  const a = arr.filter((el, i) => i !== arr.indexOf(el));    //create array where the index of the first occurrence must not be equal to the index of the current element
  const b = a.filter((el1, i1)=> i1===a.indexOf(el1));       //create 2nd array where we choose the value that has the index of the last occurrence.
  return b;
}
